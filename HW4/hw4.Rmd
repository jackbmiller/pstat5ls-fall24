# Don't Forget to Rename your Document

To avoid your work being overwritten, **rename** this file (`hw4.Rmd`). You could add your name to the file name (e.g., `hw4-profmiller.Rmd`).

## Heights of 10-year-old Children
Heights of 10-year-old children, regardless of sex, closely follow a normal distribution with mean 55 inches and standard deviation 6 inches.

The following chunks can be used for you to calculate the answers to this question in the homework. (Hint: You have examples of using `pnorm()` and `qnorm()` in Lab 4 and in Slide Set 4.)


```{r shorterthan48, error = T}
# Use this chunk to find the probability that a randomly chosen 10-year-old is shorter than 48 inches 



```


```{r between60and65, error = T}
# Use this chunk to find the probability that a randomly chosen 10-year-old is between 60 and 65 inches 



```


```{r tallest10pct, error = T}
# Use this chunk to find the height cutoff for "very tall" if the tallest 10% of 10-year-olds are considered "very tall"



```


```{r noRide, error = T}
# The height requirement for Batman the Ride at Six Flags Magic Mountain is 54 inches. Use this chunk to find the proportion of 10-year-olds cannot go on this ride



```
